ACRYLIC

Acrylic is wonderful for a lot of uses, including ami. It is machine washable, which is the first important item to consider! It’s also relatively inexpensive, but since the projects are small that isn’t as much of a factor as larger projects.

Acrylic yarn can be found in just about any color you can imagine, too, so the sky is the limit when crocheting an ami out of this fiber! This yarn isn’t too rough on your hands as you work it (unlike some of the bargain acrylics of the old days!) and it is very durable.

COTTON

Another popular choice is cotton yarn. This fiber has amazing stitch definition and is what I prefer for the bodies of my amigurumi dolls and other toys. Then, I make the clothes (if I’m making any) out of acrylic.

Cotton is also machine washable and very durable. It can tend to stretch out of shape if it gets wet a lot, though, so keep that in mind when choosing your yarn.

You can find sturdy cotton yarn made for kitchen use in most any color and very inexpensively. I prefer a softer cotton or even a cotton blend, as we will see below.
